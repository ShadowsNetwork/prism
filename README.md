As long as DOWS is locked in, synthetic assets can be issued.# 1. BuildingInstall Rust:```bashcurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh```Make sure you have `submodule.recurse` set to true to make life with submodule easier.```bashgit config --global submodule.recurse true```Install required tools and install git hooks:```bashmake init```Build all native code:```bashmake build```# 2. RunYou can start a development chain with:```bashmake run```# 3. DevelopmentTo type check:```bashmake check```To purge old chain data:```bashmake purge```To purge old chain data and run```bashmake restart```
