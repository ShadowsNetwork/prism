// This allows us to use manual seal to author blocks quickly without violating
// timestamp assumptions made by either the Aura pallet or the Timestamp pallet.

// This code was taken from https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/170
// When shadows updates to a Frontier version that includes that PR, we should re-evaluate
